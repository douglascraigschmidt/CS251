  <h3>Array (Assignment 1)</h3>

  <h4>Getting Started</h4>

  <p>
    Before you start with Assignment 1 you'll need to do the following
    things:
  </p>za

  <ul>
    <li>
      Download and install Eclipse Luna for Android. Instructions for
      doing this are available <a href="https://vanderbilt.coursera.org/cs251-001/wiki/Installing_and_Using_Eclipse_and_Git">here</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
      Setup an account on <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, which is explained in a
      video by Mike Walker.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Overview of the Array Assignment</h4>

  <p>
    The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience using Eclipse
    to develop a simple Java Array class.  An Array is an abstract data
    type (ADT) with operations such as get(), get(), and size(). Your task
    is to implement an array of characters in Java.  This array will be
    different from Java built-in arrays since it can be resized.
  </p>
  <p>
    Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for graduate
    credit) must do the following additional work:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implement the requirements of the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html">Iterable</a> interface.

  </ul>

  <p>
    As much as possible, you should avoid using loops in this assignment.  In our solution, we only needed to use an explicit looping construct once.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following resources may be helpful in completing this assignment:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html">java.utils.Arrays documentation.</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/">The Oracle Java Tutorial</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p>
    Skeleton code for this assignment is available
    <a href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS251/tree/master/assignments/assignment1/">here</a>
    account.  Once you've setup your <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
    skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
    "TODO" markers.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may choose to use <a href="https://www.gradle.org">Gradle</a>
    to build your solution.  This tool will both compile <b>and</b>
    test your solution.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that the unit tests for this assignment are currently
    incomplete, a revised test suite will be distributed later this
    week.
  </p>

  <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
  <p>
    This assignment is intentionally designed to be easy to help you get
    familiar with installing/using Eclipse and Java.  If you find it
    extremely hard to complete this assignment you may not be ready to
    take this class.  If this is the case, please meet with me ASAP to
    discuss.
